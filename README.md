<ul>
  <li>UNSPSC coding is an international standard of spend classification.</li>
  <li>UNSPSC coding consists of unique number along with its description.</li>
  <li>UNSPSC code descriptions are taken as features in ML model training.</li>
  <li>Team's Clusters (f.e.: Information Technologies, Logistic) are taken as labels in ML model training.</li>
  <li>Accuracy for the model equals 80% which for our purpose is totally enough.</li>
  <li>Application: we can use the script to recoginze Team's Cluster based on gived UNSPSC assigned to spend.</li>
